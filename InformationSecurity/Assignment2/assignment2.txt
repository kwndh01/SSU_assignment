Total: 10 points

Q1. (1 point) Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is one kind of popular hash function, where SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms can produce hash values with 256, 384, and 512 bits in length, respectively. Please explain why we usually say SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms are designed to match the security of AES with 128, 192, and 256 bits, respectively.

Q2. (1 point) Using Euclid’s gcd theorem, determine the following. Show the complete process.
(a) gcd(24140,16762)

Q3. (2 points) Using the "extended" Euclidean algorithm, find the multiplicative inverse of the following. Show the complete process with all columns. If you used a programming code, include the code and the output.
(a) 1234 mod 4321
(b) 550 mod 1769

Q4. (4 points: 2 points for encryption and 2 points for decryption)
Write a programming code that can encrypt and decrypt using S-AES (Simplified AES) [1-4]. Test data: A binary plaintext of 0110 1111 0110 1011 encrypted with a binary key of 1010 0111 0011 1011 should give a binary ciphertext of 0000 0111 0011 1000. Decryption should work correspondingly. Provide the code and the execution proof. You will need to look up some additional information, such as the Galois field, for your implementation.

Q5. (2 points) Implement a differential cryptanalysis attack on 1-round S-AES. Explain the logic behind the attack. Show all steps.
